# 💫 About Me:
I am a Full Stack Web Developer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in Software Engineering at Chandigarh University (2023–2026). I have hands-on experience in building responsive and scalable web applications using modern technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I am trained through Apna College, where I gained practical exposure to real-world development workflows, RESTful API design, and version control using Git and GitHub.<br>My technical expertise spans both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I focus on clean UI design, mobile-first responsiveness, and performance optimization using frameworks such as Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. On the backend, I develop secure and scalable APIs, work with NoSQL databases like MongoDB as well as relational databases like MySQL, and understand core concepts such as API security and database optimization.<br>I have completed multiple projects, including an Amazon frontend clone, an Online Banking Software system utilizing SQL for data analysis, and a full-stack Attendance Management Application with role-based access control and real-time dashboards. These projects strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of full-stack architecture.<br>In addition to technical skills, I bring strong communication abilities, adaptability, and a self-motivated mindset. I actively leverage Artificial Intelligence tools to improve productivity and development efficiency. I am continuously learning and aim to grow as a professional full stack developer capable of delivering reliable and user-centric software solutions. <br>ATS My Resume
